## Overview

### Planned Main Features
- procedural, parameter driven track generation (different difficulties) :heavy_check_mark:
- more appealing / demanding drive physics / features (e.g. drifting)

### Possible Side Features
- more complex ai
- include more complex track features (like loopings)

### Current State
- two static maps
- procedurally generated map
- simple ai that follows waypoints on a straight line
- simple hoverblock with questionable physics
- round timers are observed but not printed
- checkpoint observation for ai and player
- player can reset his hoverblock to the next waypoint by pressing a key
- rudimental main menu


### Bugs / Problems / Ideas

- if ai is upside down, it simply stays there
- if player is upside down, camera clips through the ground
- show round timers
- at the beginning of the race, show a matinee where the camera slowly moves towards the players hoverblock :heavy_check_mark:
- drifting
- ~~simultaneous input from keyboard and controller doubles movement speed~~
- braking is exremely fast / reactions to movement input are too instant / too big

### What should stay as it is?
- graphics
- basic idea of hovering blocks
