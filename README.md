# Hoverblocks by Brigade Vollrausch

This is our contribution as 'Brigade Vollrausch' to the 2nd Game Jam [(link)](https://imld.de/gamejam/) of the faculty of computer science at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden. Our group consisted of three crazy people (hence our group name) and we originally had 48 hours to create this masterpiece. 

Our game is about hovering blocks!

For more information about our game design, see [design_document.md](design_document.md)!

Since it is possible that we further develop this game, the master branch can have updated game files that derivate from our original GameJam release. If you are interested in our original GameJam 2018 release, have a look at the [Original GameJam 2018 Release branch](../../tree/Original_GameJam_Release) or [this release](../../releases/tag/v1.0).
